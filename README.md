# Shell scripts algorithms
### **Challenge1 - Word Count**
>Create a Shell Script that counts how many words exist within a text file. Tip: Use the wc command with your linux syntaxes.

### **Challenge2 - Create Folders**
>Create a Shell Script that automatically creates 10 directories.
Tip: Use repeating loops.

### **Challenge3 - Password Generation**
>Create a Shell Script that generates a random password. When the script is executed, the console should ask which password length I want and typing the numeric value it returns with a random password containing lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers.
<br>Tip: On Unix-like operating systems, /dev/random, /dev/urandom, and /dev/arandom are special files that serve as pseudo-random number generators.

### **Challenge4 - Log Cleaning**
>Create a Shell Script that removes all .log files that are more than 7 days old inside the /var/log directory<br>
Note: For this question you do not need to use crontab.<br>
Hint: It is possible to verify the days using the -mtime attribute of the find command

### **Challenge5** - Calculator

>Using functions, develop a calculator that performs the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
  
The Shell Script when executed must contain a menu to type the desired mathematical operation option.

Tip:
To make it easier, I will attach an example of how to program a function that performs the addition operation within the calculator.
